# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem to be solved in this course was using data structures to sort/find things such as the advising project or bids.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To solve the problem I developed several data structure types, vector, hash table, BST. It is important to understand them due to how useful they are in real world applications.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I looked at zybooks and outside sources like websites for help. Some were much more helpful than others.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work will now include data structures that are the best for the specific problem since we learned about them.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I'm definitely writing more inline comments which will help with readability and in a way, maintainability since specific parts can be easily found and changed
